## Questions

1. What is the difference between `new` and `create` for a model?
  Also, create commits and saves automatically when new does not.

2. What command followed after with `Cat.new` will emulate the same behavior as `Cat.create`?
  save

3. What is the default integer column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
  ID Column

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "Kira" in the database?
  Cat.create(name:"Kira")

5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?
  Having a walkthrough helped, but I still have trouble debugging because it's
  not very user friendly. Giving examples of what one would do with
  something similar but different enough from the problem would probably
  help significantly.
